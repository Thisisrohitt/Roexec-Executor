Architecture overview
- Core runner: Executes commands and scripts. Handles timeouts, exit codes, and captures stdout and stderr.
- Scheduler: Reads schedule definitions and triggers the core runner.
- Store: Keeps job metadata and logs. Supports local file backend and optional remote backend.
- API server: Exposes endpoints to list jobs, run jobs, and stream logs.
- CLI: Small command set to install, run, and manage.

Flow
1. User defines job in YAML or via CLI.
2. Scheduler picks job at correct time.
3. Core runner executes the job in a set context.
4. Runner writes logs and metadata to the store.
5. API serves job status and logs.

Docker and container use
- Pull image (example)
  - docker pull ghcr.io/thisisrohitt/roexec-executor:latest
- Run as container
  - docker run -d --name roexec \
    -v /var/lib/roexec:/data \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    ghcr.io/thisisrohitt/roexec-executor:latest \
    server --config /data/config.yml
- Example docker-compose

    services:
      roexec:
        image: ghcr.io/thisisrohitt/roexec-executor:latest
        volumes:
          - ./data:/data
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        command: server --config /data/config.yml

Configuration (YAML)
- Config file controls scheduler, store, API, and defaults.
- Example: /etc/roexec/config.yml
  - server:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 8080
  - store:
      type: local
      path: /var/lib/roexec
  - scheduler:
      max-concurrent: 10
  - defaults:
      timeout: 60s
      retries: 2

Job file format (jobs.yml)
- jobs:
  - id: backup-db
    name: Backup database
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    command: /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
    env:
      DB_HOST: db.internal
      DB_USER: backup
    timeout: 1h
    retries: 3
    backoff: 30s
    notify:
      on_failure: /usr/local/bin/notify.sh

  - Run a raw command: roexec exec -- cmd ls -la

Options
- --config PATH: Use config file.
- --store PATH: Override store path.
- --verbose: Increase log level.
- --dry-run: Validate job set without registering.

HTTP API
- The server exposes a small API. Default endpoint: http://localhost:8080
- Endpoints
  - GET /api/v1/jobs
    - List jobs.
  - GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}
    - Job details.
  - POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/run
    - Trigger job run.
    - Payload: {"env": {"KEY": "VAL"}}
  - GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/logs
    - Stream run logs.
  - GET /api/v1/health
    - Health check.

Example curl calls
- List jobs
  - curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs
- Trigger job
  - curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs/backup-db/run
- Stream logs
  - curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/runs/abcd1234/logs

Scheduler examples
- Basic cron
  - schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  - Runs midnight daily.
- Every 15 minutes
  - schedule: "*/15 * * * *"
- Weekday only
  - schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"
- Advanced: cron + window
  - schedule: "0 12 * * *"
  - window:
      start: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      end: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  - Scheduler skips runs outside the window.

Retry and backoff
- retries: Number of attempts after first failure.
- backoff: Fixed backoff before next attempt.
- Example:
  - retries: 5
  - backoff: 1m
  - This retries up to five times with one minute between attempts.

Concurrency and limits
- Per-job limits:
  - max-concurrent: Number of parallel runs allowed per job.
  - Example:
    - job:
        id: sync
        max-concurrent: 2
- Global limits:
  - scheduler.max-concurrent: Max total concurrent runs.

Hooks and events
- Hooks run as commands before or after job runs.
- Supported hooks:
  - pre_run: Run before the job command.
  - post_run: Run after the job finishes (success or fail).
  - on_success: Run when job succeeds.
  - on_failure: Run when job fails.
- Example:
  - hooks:
      pre_run: /usr/local/bin/pre-check.sh
      on_failure: /usr/local/bin/alert.sh

Sample job with hooks
- jobs:
  - id: deploy
    command: /usr/local/bin/deploy.sh
    hooks:
      pre_run: /usr/local/bin/check-prereqs.sh
      post_run: /usr/local/bin/cleanup.sh
      on_failure: /usr/local/bin/notify-ops.sh

Logging and observability
- Roexec stores logs as text files by default.
- Default log path: /var/lib/roexec/logs
- Log rotation:
  - roexec rotates logs daily and keeps the last 7 days.
- JSON export:
  - roexec supports exporting logs in JSON for ingestion.
  - roexec logs export --format json --since 24h > logs.json
- External collectors
  - You can push logs to external systems through hooks or the API.
  - Example: on_finish hook that posts logs to an HTTP endpoint.

Log sample (plain)
- /var/lib/roexec/logs/backup-db/2025-08-01T02:00:00.log
  - 2025-08-01T02:00:00Z [INFO] Starting run
  - 2025-08-01T02:00:02Z [INFO] Running /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
  - 2025-08-01T02:05:15Z [INFO] Completed, exit=0

Monitoring
- Health endpoint: /api/v1/health
- Metrics:
  - roexec exposes Prometheus metrics at /metrics when enabled.
  - Metrics cover run_count, run_duration_seconds, run_errors_total.

Security and user permissions
- Run with least privilege.
- Do not run arbitrary user scripts as root.
- Use per-job user mapping:
  - job:
      id: app-maintenance
      user: appuser
- File permissions:
  - Store files should be owned by the service user.
  - /var/lib/roexec should not be world writable.

Secrets and environment
- Avoid putting secrets in job YAML in plain text.
- Use environment injection via secure systems:
  - Integrate with Vault via hooks.
  - Use host-level environment variables for service.
- Example secret placeholder:
  - env_from:
      secret: vault://secret/data/roexec/backup-db

Resource limits and timeouts
- timeout enforces the max wall time. The runner sends SIGTERM then SIGKILL after a grace period.
- Memory limits: Runner can enforce memory limits when run in a container. For native runs, rely on cgroups or containers.

Integration examples
- GitHub Actions
  - Run a Roexec job as part of a workflow:
    - - name: Trigger Roexec job
        run: curl -X POST http://roexec.example/api/v1/jobs/deploy/run
- CI
  - Use roexec to run nightly test suites and store logs for analysis.
- Slack
  - Hook into on_failure to post messages.
  - Example:
    - on_failure: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Job failed"}' https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxx

Advanced usage
- Pipeline mode
  - Chain jobs to run in order with inputs and outputs.
  - Example:
    - pipeline:
        - id: build
          command: ./build.sh
        - id: test
          command: ./test.sh
          depends_on: [build]
        - id: deploy
          command: ./deploy.sh
          depends_on: [test]
- Conditional runs
  - Use exit code patterns or log checks.
  - Example:
    - on_success:
        - command: ./notify-success.sh
        - condition: test -f build/artifact.tar.gz

Examples and recipes
- Backup and rotate
  - jobs:
    - id: backup-db
      command: /usr/local/bin/backup-db.sh
      schedule: "0 3 * * *"
      timeout: 2h
      on_success: /usr/local/bin/rotate-backups.sh
- Web health checker every 5 minutes
  - jobs:
    - id: web-check
      command: curl -fS https://example.com/health || exit 1
      schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
      on_failure: /usr/local/bin/alert-web.sh
- Deploy with canary
  - jobs:
    - id: deploy-canary
      command: ./deploy.sh --canary
      schedule: ""
      on_success: ./promote.sh --if-checks-pass

API token example
- roexec supports basic auth and token auth.
- To create a token:
  - roexec token create --name ci-token --scope run:list,run:create
  - The server stores tokens in the store. Use them in API calls:
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs/deploy/run

Store backends
- Local file (default)
  - path: /var/lib/roexec
  - Good for single-instance or simple installs.
- SQLite
  - type: sqlite
  - path: /var/lib/roexec/roexec.db
- Remote store (optional)
  - type: s3
  - bucket: roexec-store
  - Use remote stores for HA setups. The runner caches metadata locally.

High availability and clustering (advanced)
- Roexec supports a leader election mode for multiple instances.
- Use a shared store and set one instance as leader.
- Config option:
  - clustering:
      enabled: true
      leader_election: etcd://etcd-cluster:2379

Best practices
- Keep jobs small and focused.
- Use retries for flaky tasks.
- Use hooks to centralize alerting.
- Limit max-concurrent runs to avoid resource spikes.
- Use containers for isolation when running untrusted code.
- Use separate stores for staging and production.

Contribute
- Want to help? Steps:
  - Fork the repo.
  - Create a branch for your feature.
  - Write tests for new code.
  - Run go test ./...
  - Submit a pull request.
- Coding style:
  - Keep commands simple and clear.

Development setup
- Install Go 1.20+ (or the version listed in go.mod).
- Clone and build:
  - git clone https://github.com/Thisisrohitt/Roexec-Executor.git
  - cd Roexec-Executor
  - go build ./...
- Run tests:
  - go test ./...

Testing jobs locally
- Use the built-in local store:
  - mkdir -p /tmp/roexec
  - roexec server --config examples/config-local.yml --store /tmp/roexec
- Apply example jobs:
  - roexec apply -f examples/jobs.yml

Roadmap (examples of planned items)
- Add plugin system for custom runners.
- Add interactive web UI for job control.
- Add role-based access control (RBAC).
- Add more store backends and better multi-node support.

Troubleshooting
- If a job does not start:
  - Check scheduler.max-concurrent and job max-concurrent.
  - Check the system logs for permission errors.
- If logs are missing:
  - Ensure the store path is correct and writable.
  - Check the service user file permissions.
- If the API returns 401:
  - Verify token or credentials.
  - Check auth config in the server.

Example troubleshooting commands
- Check service status
  - sudo systemctl status roexec
- Tail the server log
  - journalctl -u roexec -f
- List jobs via API
  - curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs
